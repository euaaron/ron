# RON

RON - **Run On Node**, is a Node.js version manager made using [bun](https://bun.sh)\* and [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js), and written in [typescript](https://typescriptlang.com).

## WIP Disclaimer

RON is still **work in progress**, and everything, including language (tech) and libs, are susceptible to change.
